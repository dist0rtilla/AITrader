# Strategy Engine ML Integration Summary

## Completed Implementation

The Strategy Engine has been successfully enhanced with ML service integration as requested. This addresses the user's concern that "The Strategy engine is not showing connections to the other engines."

## New Files Created

### 1. `/strategy_engine/ml_client.py`
- **Purpose**: HTTP clients for ML service communication
- **Components**:
  - `ONNXClient`: Price prediction via ONNX Runner
  - `TensorRTClient`: GPU-accelerated predictions via TensorRT Runner  
  - `SentimentClient`: Market sentiment analysis via Sentiment Engine
  - `MLServiceManager`: Orchestrates all ML services with parallel inference

### 2. `/strategy_engine/enhanced_strategy_service.py` 
- **Purpose**: Enhanced trading strategy with ML integration
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-factor decision making (technical + ML + sentiment)
  - Dual-path inference (ONNX + TensorRT with fallback)
  - Real-time price history tracking for ML predictions
  - Enhanced position sizing based on confidence and volatility
  - Comprehensive logging and performance tracking

### 3. `/pattern_engine/pattern_detector.py`
- **Purpose**: Missing Pattern Engine service that was referenced in docker-compose
- **Features**:
  - EMA/VWAP/volatility pattern detection
  - Real-time signal generation to Redis streams
  - Mock tick data generation for development

## Enhanced Architecture

### Before Enhancement
```
Strategy Engine â”€â”€â”€â”€ Redis (signals in)
       â”‚
       â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Redis (orders out)
```

### After Enhancement  
```
Pattern Engine â”€â”€â”€â”€ Redis â”€â”€â”€â”€ Strategy Engine â”€â”€â”€â”€ ML Services â”€â”€â”€â”€ Redis
       â”‚                            â”‚                    â”‚              â”‚
   Signal Gen                  Enhanced Decisions    Predictions    Orders Out
                                       â”‚                    â”‚
                                   Sentiment           ONNX/TensorRT
                                   Analysis             Inference
```

## ML Integration Features

### 1. **Dual-Path Inference**
- ONNX Runner (CPU): Always available, consistent performance
- TensorRT Runner (GPU): High-performance when GPU available
- Automatic failover: TensorRT â†’ ONNX â†’ default if services unavailable

### 2. **Multi-Factor Decision Making**
- **Technical Indicators**: SMA trend, RSI momentum, ATR volatility
- **ML Predictions**: Price forecasts with confidence scoring
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Market sentiment from news/social data
- **Pattern Signals**: Enhanced pattern detection from Pattern Engine

### 3. **Risk Management**
- Position sizing based on ML confidence and volatility
- Signal strength thresholds prevent weak trades
- Maximum position limits for risk control
- Enhanced metadata tracking for all decisions

## Service Connections Established

| Service | Port | Connection Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|----------------|---------|  
| ONNX Runner | 8001 | HTTP Client | Price predictions |
| Sentiment Engine | 8002 | HTTP Client | Market sentiment |
| TensorRT Runner | 8007 | HTTP Client | GPU predictions |
| Pattern Engine | Internal | Redis Streams | Signal generation |
| Mock MCP | 9000 | HTTP Client | Market data |

## Performance Improvements

### 1. **Parallel Processing**
- Simultaneous ML service calls reduce latency
- Async HTTP clients prevent blocking
- Concurrent signal and fill processing

### 2. **Smart Caching**
- Price history maintained for ML predictions
- Sentiment results cached to reduce API calls
- Health status caching for service availability

### 3. **Enhanced Monitoring**
- Comprehensive statistics tracking
- Health check endpoints for all services
- Detailed logging for debugging and analysis

## Configuration

### Docker Compose Updates
- Strategy Engine now depends on ONNX Runner and Sentiment Engine
- Environment variables configured for all ML service URLs
- Enhanced requirements.txt with ML client dependencies

### Environment Variables
```bash
ONNX_RUNNER_URL=http://onnx_runner:8001
SENTIMENT_ENGINE_URL=http://sentiment_engine:8002  
TENSORRT_RUNNER_URL=http://tensorrt_runner:8007
MIN_SIGNAL_THRESHOLD=0.3
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=1000
```

## Testing Commands

### 1. **Build and Start Enhanced System**
```bash
docker compose up --build strategy_engine pattern_engine onnx_runner sentiment_engine
```

### 2. **Health Check All Services**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8005/health  # Strategy Engine
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # ONNX Runner  
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Sentiment Engine
```

### 3. **Monitor Signal Flow**
```bash
docker compose logs -f strategy_engine pattern_engine
```

## Integration Status

âœ… **Completed**:
- ML client implementation with all three services
- Enhanced strategy service with multi-factor decisions
- Missing Pattern Engine service created
- Docker compose configuration updated
- Service dependency mapping established

ðŸ”§ **Ready for Testing**:
- End-to-end signal flow: Pattern â†’ Strategy â†’ ML â†’ Orders
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Real market data integration

## Next Steps

1. **Test ML Integration**: Verify ONNX Runner and Sentiment Engine connections
2. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize ML service timeouts and retry logic  
3. **Real Data Integration**: Connect to live market data feeds
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement comprehensive system monitoring

The Strategy Engine now has full connections to all other engines as requested, with ML-powered decision making and comprehensive service integration.
