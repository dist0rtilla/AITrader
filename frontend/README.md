# AITrader Frontend (SPA)

This document describes the single-page application (SPA) frontend for AITrader, its features, directory layout, development workflow, and how it integrates with the backend services.

Instruction source: `docs/instructions/copilot-instructions.md`

## Purpose

The SPA is a lightweight control panel for monitoring system components, visualizing model predictions, reviewing sentiment, launching training, and inspecting the database and execution flows. It's built with React + Vite + TypeScript and uses Tailwind for styling.

## ðŸš€ **Fast Development Options**

### **Quick Start - Local Development** (Fastest)
Requirements: Node 18+, npm

```bash
# From project root
./hostexecs/quick-start.sh
# Available at: http://localhost:5173
# âœ… 0 seconds build time, instant hot reload
```

### **Frontend Docker Development** (Consistent Environment)
Requirements: Docker, Docker Compose

```bash
# From project root  
./hostexecs/dev-frontend.sh
# Available at: http://localhost:8080
# âœ… ~30s one-time build, instant file changes
```

### **Full Stack Development** (Complete System)
Requirements: Docker, Docker Compose

```bash
# From project root  
./hostexecs/dev-fullstack.sh
# Available at: http://localhost:8080 (Frontend), http://localhost:8000 (API)
# âœ… Complete backend integration
```

> Note: The legacy `scripts/` directory is retained for backwards compatibility but `hostexecs/` is now the canonical location for host-side helper scripts. Update references to `./hostexecs/` when adding new developer workflows.

### **Manual Local Development**
Requirements: Node 18+, npm, Docker (for proxy/backends)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the app at `http://localhost:5173` (local dev) or use `./hostexecs/dev-frontend.sh` for Docker development at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Build for production

1. Build the SPA:

   npm run build

2. The `dist/` output will be copied by the `frontend/Dockerfile` into the nginx image used by `frontend` in `docker-compose.dev-fullstack.yml`.

## Test

Run unit/smoke tests:

  npm test

## Recent Improvements (September 2025)

### âœ… **Fixed: Trading Signals Display**
- **Issue**: Trading signals were being cut off and using unnecessary scrollbars
- **Solution**: Redesigned with compact layout showing 4 signals maximum with "View All" button
- **Design**: Removed scrollbars entirely - signals now fit perfectly in container
- **Layout**: Compact signal rows with inline time display and mini chart indicators
- **UX**: Added "View All X Signals â†’" button when more than 4 signals available

### âœ… **Complete Dark Glass UI System**
- **Theme Switching**: Full dark/light mode with persistent storage and system preference detection
- **Glass Morphism**: Professional backdrop blur effects with semi-transparent surfaces
- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic theme switching using CSS custom properties
- **Components**: All components redesigned with glass effects and smooth animations
- **Navigation**: Theme switcher integrated into TopNav with glass styling

### âœ… **Enhanced Responsiveness**
- **Grid Layout**: Improved responsive grid system for monitor dashboard
- **Container Management**: Better height constraints and scrolling for content overflow
- **Glass Containers**: Consistent glass morphism across all major components

**ðŸ“‹ Design System**: See [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](../docs/frontend/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) for complete UI guidelines and container guardrails.

## Features (top-level)

- **Monitor (home)** â€” Real-time system and component status, GPU metrics, ONNX Runner status, inference latency with glass morphism UI
- **Signals** â€” Scrollable table of signals with sparklines, ranking, filters, symbol drilldown (fixed overflow issue)
- **Predictions** â€” âœ… **ENHANCED**: ML model forecasts with N-BEATS, LSTM, and Transformer models, confidence intervals, filtering by model type and confidence score
- **Sentiment** â€” âœ… **ENHANCED**: FinBERT-powered sentiment analysis with source tracking, authenticity scoring, time window filtering, and market overview dashboard
- **Executions** â€” Order entry UI and execution history
- **Training** â€” Training control panel for ML runs (N-BEATS, etc.)
- **Metrics / DB** â€” Prometheus metrics links and database exploration tools

### âœ… **New: Enhanced Predictions Features**
- **Multi-Model Support**: N-BEATS, LSTM, and Transformer model predictions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Visual confidence indicators with color-coded reliability
- **Forecast Visualization**: Mini charts showing 5-period price forecasts
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by model type, minimum confidence threshold
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh with live prediction data
- **Glass Morphism UI**: Consistent with overall design system

### âœ… **New: Enhanced Sentiment Features**
- **FinBERT Integration**: Finance-tuned BERT model for accurate sentiment analysis
- **Source Tracking**: Attribution to trusted news sources (Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ, etc.)
- **Market Overview**: Aggregated bullish/bearish/neutral sentiment distribution
- **Time Window Filtering**: 1h, 4h, 1d, 1w sentiment analysis windows
- **Authenticity Scoring**: Source reliability and content authenticity metrics
- **Visual Sentiment Scale**: Interactive sentiment score visualization (-1.0 to +1.0)

## Integration points

- Backend API base: `/api/` (proxied to backend service in Docker Compose)
- WebSocket monitor: `/api/ws/monitor` (server pushes component updates)

## Development notes

- **Tailwind Processing**: Tailwind is processed during `npm run build` / `vite dev`. The `src/styles.css` contains Tailwind directives and CSS variables for theme system
- **Theme System**: Uses React Context (`src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`) with CSS variables for dynamic dark/light mode switching
- **Glass UI**: Complete glass morphism design system with backdrop blur, CSS variables, and custom Tailwind classes
- **Scrolling**: Custom scrollbar styling for glass theme consistency (`.custom-scrollbar` class)
- **Nginx Serving**: If serving `dist/` via nginx, ensure asset paths match (the built index may reference `/ui/*` depending on the build base). See `frontend/nginx.conf`

## Where to add features

- Add API clients to `src/api/` (e.g., `predictionsClient.ts`, `sentimentClient.ts`).
- Add hooks to `src/hooks/` (e.g., `useSignals.ts`, `usePredictions.ts`, `useSentiment.ts`).
- Add pages to `src/pages/` (e.g., `MonitorPage.tsx`, `SignalsPage.tsx`, `PredictionsPage.tsx`).
- Add components under `src/components/` grouped by feature.

## Contributing

Follow the repository `.github` guidelines; add tests for any new UI features and keep PRs small. Avoid committing large build artifacts or node_modules.
Frontend SPA placeholder. Use React + Vite. Pages: Home (monitor), Execution, Database, Settings, Strategies.
WebSocket connect to backend `/api/ws/monitor` for realtime status.
